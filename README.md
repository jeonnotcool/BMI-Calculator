# BMI-Calculator
This is a project for Computer Education 10. A simple BMI calculator written on Visual Basic.

For the project, I have created a simple BMI calculator that calculates the BMI of a person based on their weight and height. 
The program also provides a brief description of the BMI value and the health status of the person.

I have also added comments to the code to explain the purpose of each line of code so that it is easy to understand.s
